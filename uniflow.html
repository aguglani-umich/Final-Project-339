This process was tricky because students always had the biggest problems, but campus administrators would be our end-customer. Ultimately we knew we wanted to build a software platform and by generating problem statements for each of our stakeholders. <br><br><span class="text-span-4">For Students</span><br>Students struggle to centralize, understand, and join the best-fit opportunities for them when coming to campus.<br><br><span class="text-span-4">For Campus Leaders</span><br>Campus Leaders are challenged with communicating the unique value add of their organization and displaying new and relevant information to the student body.<br><br><span class="text-span-4">For Campus Administrators </span><br>Campus Administrators are flying blind when knowing how engaged their students are.

      <h3 class="subhead">2. Seek Signal From Users</h3>
      <div class="content-body">Listening to what customers care about is one of my highest priorities when building a user experience. I used surveys, questionnaires ,and interviews to conduct primary user research and build personas for key stakeholders when designing the UniFlow platform. I focused in on heuristic evaluation, persona creation, and qualitative research in particular during a 2 month customer discovery process that spanned May to July of 2020. <br><br>The basics of the program were to identify user constraints. and gather as much context as possible around how to accomplish the job to be done in the most efficient and effective way as possible. I followed these linear set of steps to gather the signal I needed.<br><br>1. I talked to 5 or so friends who studied different subjects at the University of Michigan to get a basic sense of the sheer range of things they would want in a campus engagement / club discovery tool.<br><br>2. I created a Google Form using a mix of feature rank choose, short answer ,and this or that questions. I posted this form with completion attached to a lottery for a financial incentive in incoming Freshmen facebook groups at 5 major universities with vastly different profiles (large public, small public, LAC, small-private, large-private). I got around 60 responses per school. This allowed me to create data and charts around student preferences and how they would want the platform to work. <br><br>3. I interviewed two people from each school (10 total) who submitted the form and ran through the interview script (excerpt above) to crystallize my hypothesizes. I did these interviews with another colleague who recorded notes while I ran the interview<br><br>4. I summarized my findings and compared it against a assumptions grid I created before embarking on the process. I was able to share my findings with the rest of my team and they informed several product decisions in the following months.<br><br>These exercise allowed me to pinpoint the genesis of our platform and what value we offered to students. Our signal gathering process for club leaders and administrators was completed by our sales team. <br><br>‍<br>‍</div><img src="images/UniFlow.png" loading="eager" width="586" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 1439px) 919.9999389648438px, 1100px" alt="UniFlow makes opportunities more accessible bycertralizing, recommending, and guiding students about extracurricular opportunities " srcset="images/UniFlolib-p-500.png 500w, images/UniFlolib-p-800.png 800w, images/UniFlow.png 1015w" class="uniflolib-image-box">

      <div class="content-body">Once I had a broad sense of what users were looking to accomplish and what they value, I started by thinking about product specifications and began to wireframe. I often picked up my iPad and pencil and went to a quiet place to draw out a few different takes on flows that solved user problems. Unfortunately my hand writing is not neat enough to show you a wall of wireframes, but I prioritized getting as rough of a sketch down as possible. This allowed me to take these designs to the team and visualize the product requirements documents I was drafting in parallel. Where needed, I would use Framer to make simplified wireframes and have them be interactive for use in interviews or with the development team. </div>

      <div class="content-body">When building the UniFlow design system, I wanted to combine existing usability heuristics with techniques and approaches unique to our product. I believe this would allows us to create a familiar experience for users, but give us permission to experiment on how we could display information unique to our use case more effectively. When approaching creating a design system, I would go to Dribble and look at my favorite products to see what design patterns I thought were effective and identified how they could apply to the UniFlow platform. I also consulted various brand building principals and color psychology to implement these three existing design techniques to our platform:<br><br><span class="text-span-4">Let Unique Content Shine</span><br>Highlight unique content from platform stakeholders shine to create fluidity, trust, and compelling visuals <br><br><span class="text-span-4">Use Shadows to Depict Hierarchy </span><br>Simplify high density information displays by using hierarchy to illuminate important content <br><br><span class="text-span-4">White is the New White</span><br>Using copious amounts of white allows the interface fade into the background and let dynamic content take center stage. White allows you to deliver a decluttered, luxurious, and bright experience to users.<br><br><br>Through experience in designing older versions of the platform and design books I have read, I decided to bring the following more unique visual patters to our design system.<br><br><br><span class="text-span-4">Build for Mobile First</span><br>I used constructs like cards and swipes to reconcile the large amount of Gen-z traffic we have who are used to mobile experiences. <br>‍<br><span class="text-span-4">Gradients for UI Elements</span><br>Gradients were all the range and then got out of hand to say the least. They have now found their place mostly in product marketing visuals, but I decided to use gradients in our UI elements to be both eye-catching and illuminate the &quot;flow&quot; in UniFlow. <br><br><span class="text-span-6">Multiple Data Displays </span><br>Everything on UniFlow has two ways to represent it. For example clubs on UniFlow can be viewed as either a popup or a full page. We use two data displays for core constructs on UniFlow to match the correct visual container to the correct situation.<br><br>The header image of this section is a clear representation of our design patterns and system in action . Every piece of our platform is governed by a design system that is a carefully balanced depiction of who we are as a brand and the people we build for. <br><br><br></div><img src="images/Grids--Spacers.png" loading="eager" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 627.98291015625px" srcset="images/Grids--Spacers-p-500.png 500w, images/Grids--Spacers.png 628w" alt="The UniFlow design system has modern fonts, spacers, and a modern color pallet" class="design-system-image">

      <div class="content-body">Pictured above is our UniFlow Campus Engagement release from January of 2021. I worked on designing the product for over 3 months hand in hand with my CTO. This process included building a product roadmap in ClickUp, organizing tasks in sprints, sizing tasks, creating design release schedules, conducting design reviews, and launching a comprehensive testing and quality assurance program. We would work in two weak sprints, where I would design flows in Figma one sprint before they began development to get feedback from users and customers. Following the conclusion of a sprint, it would be tested, QA&#x27;d and go through revisions to make sure it followed specifications and our product requirements documents that I would make. On any given day their would be several processes from drawing PRD&#x27;s to adjusting the roadmap to getting a sprint&#x27;s designs ready. This is where the magic came in. As a one person product and design team, I would often enlist sales colleges to help gather signal from the new customers they would talk to or test a particular part of the product. All in all, in everything we did, we kept the user in the center and were able to build a product with a high level of craftsmanship for our customers. </div>

      <div class="content-body">I used agile development cycles to focus on pushing out MVPs and hearing directly from users about how they use our products in their daily life. I split the product into feature families like &quot;Campus Leader - Events&quot; or &quot;Student - Virtual Fairs&quot; to be able to iterate on discrete sections of products and a time. I launched a number of programs such as surveys, user interviews, and A/B tests after each release of a feature family to hear from customers what they liked or didn&#x27;t like. Through this process, I focused on north stars to help me analyze signal and make product tradeoffs effectively.  <br><br>Our first product was distributed to customers in August of 2020 and was packed with analytics to help me track and measure performance and improve the offering. Specifically, I optimized for the following KPIs when making changes to our products</div><img src="images/Pasted-Graphic-33.png" loading="eager" width="533" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 532.9971313476562px" alt="Six metrics: Speed, Satisfaction of Visuals, Success Rate, Accessibility, Business Objectives, and User Navigation were used to generate KPIs to measure the success of UniFlow" srcset="images/Pasted-Graphic-33-p-500.png 500w, images/Pasted-Graphic-33.png 635w" class="image-box-small">
      <div class="content-body">I used the above KPIs to move feature families through ideation to publishing to improving them in future releases. These KPIs allow me to make data driven decisions in the design process and communicate the value add of approaching an existing flow in a new way. An example of the application of our process (pictured above) was our login page. In our August 2020 release, we showed users a generic user splash screen and then took them to a sign in with Microsoft or Google login page. I found through usability testing, students were confused because UniFlow never acknowledged the campus they belonged to during the sign in process. I redesigned the flow to include a school picker to improve the user navigation and success rate of the interaction. Additionally, the new flow was able to improve login speed by knowing which login provider to use based on the users university selection in our initial page which simply did not exists before. </div>
